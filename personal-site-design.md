#Personal Site Design
###What is your site's primary purpose?
I want the primary purpose of my site to be a portfolio of my work but I also want it to be a live record of my coding journey with EDA.
###Who is your target audience?
Hopefully potential employers or maybe even people I can collaborate with to build neat things.
###How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?
It would be good if my visitors can navigate the content easily and be able to access different parts of my site using links or by scrolling. I would like to design a website that is fun but functional.
###How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?
I'm going to do my best to design a responsive site using flexbox and media queries and I'd like to play around with a few different css features to see if I can make my site a bit unique and fun.
